## A Pythonic approach to Design Patterns

This repo hosts the #DPOTW series where a particular object-oriented design-pattern will be implemented
every week in a Pythonic way and in its various implementation avatars.

Discussions will happen in my twitter handle https://twitter.com/skeptichacker . Please follow the hash-tag
